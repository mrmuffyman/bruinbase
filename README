On initialization, a single leaf node is created and treated as the root.
Once the node splits, a root node is created with pointers to the split node.
Node pid starts at 1.
Pid = 0 is reserved for storing rootPid and treeHeight.

InsertHelper and locateHelper are helper functions that take extra parameters to implement recursion.
